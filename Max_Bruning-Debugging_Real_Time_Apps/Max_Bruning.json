    title: "Debugging Real-Time Apps",
    abstract: "Using DTrace and mdb to do in-situ and post-mortem debugging of Real-Time web applications are covered in this talk.  Several example applications written in node.js will be examined.  Both incorrect programs (i.e., buggy), and poorly performing programs will be covered.  The talk is aimed at developers who need to have better visibility into what their applications are doing.",
