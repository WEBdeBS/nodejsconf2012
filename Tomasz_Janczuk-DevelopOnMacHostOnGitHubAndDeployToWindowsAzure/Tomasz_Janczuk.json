    "abstract": "If you are like most node.js developers, you write your code on Mac and manage it with Git. Using git-azure you can now deploy your apps to Windows Azure without leaving the comfort of your development environment.\nGit-azure is an extension of Git that allows you to deploy multiple node.js applications from a Git repository and host them in Windows Azure, a hosting service operated by Microsoft. Git-azure then allows you to easily add and modify applications in seconds, configure SSL (including SNI), and set up routing based on URL path or host name. It provides real time access to logs generated by your node.js applications. It supports HTTP and WebSockets. Unlike other multi-app hosting environments, git-azure also offers full administrative access to your VMs such that you can install custom software or access rich diagnostic and monitoring tools.\nSome people compared using git-azure to deploying your own installation of heroku.\nFind out more at https://github.com/tjanczuk/git-azure",

        "bio": "I have spent the last 11 years helping to develop and ship software for Microsoft. My current area of focus is node.js, JavaScript, and Windows Azure. Before that I worked on .NET Framework and Silverlight, specializing in web service technologies, in particular security. I am presently engaged in technical investigations related to reducing the cost of running applications in data centers. I also enjoy driving a few open source projects. When not in front of my computer, I like hiking, skiing, diving, climbing, and sailing with my family in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.",
