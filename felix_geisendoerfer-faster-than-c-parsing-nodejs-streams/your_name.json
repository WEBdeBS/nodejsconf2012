    title: "Faster than C? Parsing Node.js Streams!",
    abstract: "In 2010 I wrote the first MySQL driver for node.js. I did it in pure JavaScript. It was fast. It was fun.\n\nA few month later, node addons using libmysql showed up in npm. They were much faster. It sucked.\n\nIn 2012 I had enough and went back to to the drawing board resulting in a much faster parser.\n\nThis talk will introduce you to the art of high performance binary stream parsing in node.js.",
