    "title": "Distributed Chess Engine",
    "abstract": "Current day implementations of Chess Engines are restricted in the number of moves they can 'think' ahead due to the limitations in processing power. Machine learning, neural networks and genetic programming can be augmented by implementing them in a highly distributed approach using multiple instances on a Cloud PaaS. In this talk we are going to present to you an example of a distributed Chess Engine implemented using NodeJS.",
