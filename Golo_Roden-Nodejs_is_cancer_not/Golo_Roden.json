    abstract: "JavaScript is bad for complex computations, so Node.js is bad for complex computations. Right? Wrong! Enter Fabric Engine, a high-performance, multithreaded computational engine that integrates perfectly with Node.js. Golo Roden (www.goloroden.de) talks about what Fabric Engine is, what it can do, and how you can use it to build ultra high-performance web applications using the language and the platform you love! Oh, by the way: En passant Golo shows how to calculate Fibonacci numbers correctly ;-).",
