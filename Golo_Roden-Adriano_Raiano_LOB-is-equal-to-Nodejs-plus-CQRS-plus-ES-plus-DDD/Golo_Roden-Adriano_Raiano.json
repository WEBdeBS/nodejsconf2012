    title: "LOB = Node.js + CQRS + ES + DDD",
    abstract: "So your #1 customer demands that you create a LOB application that runs on a single machine as well as the local network as the cloud? Phew! Suddenly, all the not-so-fancy desktop stuff comes to your mind: Reporting. Historical data. Running offline. \"Wouldn't I be better off if I had listened to my mother and learned something 'real' such as Java?\", you find asking yourself. The answer: NO! Definitely not! Node.js is an awesome platform, even for LOB applications that need to feature the usual desktop stuff - as long as you use the right architecture, i.e.: CQRS + Event Sourcing (ES) + Domain Driven Design (DDD). Golo Roden and Adriano Raiano tell you what these terms mean, how you can implement them using Node.js, and how you can make your customers feeling lucky, without having to sell your soul and do Java ;-).",
