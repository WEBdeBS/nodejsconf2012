    "abstract": "Write software in embedded world is not an easy task. Custom libraries, keychain compilers and remote debuggers are high entry barriers. Next-generation boards offer the support to Node.js! This simplify a lot the task of controlling board I/O.\n\nIn this session I'll show you how to control the I/O of a Beaglebone board (the TI open development board based on Cortex A8 - http://beagleboard.org/bone) using just JavaScript! We will see how to code in Node.js from Web to I/O control using the Cloud9 editor hosted by the board.\n\nRemember to bring with you a laptop or a mobile device to turn on/off leds attacched to the board at the end of the session!",
