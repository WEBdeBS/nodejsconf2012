    title: "Playing Nice in the Node.js Sandbox",
    abstract: "Running untrusted code is always a hairy problem in programming environments. This talk will explore some of the potential problems with running untrusted code such as: resource starvation, cpu starvation, accessing unsafe functions, and data leaking. After, it will describe various methods of sandboxing to defeat these potential problems and compare these methods for running untrusted code more securely in a Nodejs environment.",
